## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AIGuy — The AI Companion
- **Joins your server** as a real Minecraft player named "AIGuy"
- **Chats with players** — tells jokes, explains what it's doing, and responds to everything
- **Follows players** around the world with smooth movement and auto-jumping
- **Builds structures** using `/fill`, `/setblock`, `/summon`, and other commands
- **Minecraft skills cookbook** in the system prompt, with ready-to-use recipes for particles, fireworks, effects, builds, mini-games, scoreboards, gear, and world control
- **Structured Minecraft tools** for safer item giving, player effects, entity spawning, world state changes, particles, fireworks, shape building, area scans, and timed command sequences
- **Prebuilt combo skills** such as party mode, spleef arena, mob battle, parkour course, rainbow bridge, enchanted gear, light show, and base protection
- **Passive vision** — scans nearby blocks and entities every time someone chats, so it can "see" the world
- **Autonomous goal loop** — give it a complex task (e.g. "build a castle") and it will self-iterate, verify, and complete it
- **Multiple AI models** — swap models on the fly via CLI flag or in-game `!model` command

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
- **Java 17+** — Required to run the Minecraft server
- **Minecraft Java Edition** — To connect and play (version 1.20.4)
- **OpenRouter API key** — Get one free at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danshorstein/minecraft-ai-bot.git
cd minecraft-ai-bot
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up the Minecraft Server

This downloads a Paper 1.20.4 server and configures it for local play (creative mode, flat world, offline mode):

```bash
npm run setup-server
```

### 3. Start the Minecraft Server

```bash
npm run start-server
```

Wait for `Done` in the output. The server runs on `localhost:25565`.

### 4. Connect with Minecraft

Open Minecraft Java Edition (1.20.4), go to **Multiplayer** → **Direct Connect** → enter `localhost:25565`.

### 5. Launch the AI Bot

In a new terminal:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key-here"
npm run start-bot
```

The bot reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the process environment, so export it in the shell where you run `npm run start-bot`.

AIGuy will join the server and start chatting! 🚀

## 🧠 Choosing an AI Model

The bot defaults to **GLM 5.2** (`z-ai/glm-5.2`) via OpenRouter.

### CLI Flag

```bash
npm run start-bot -- --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
npm run start-bot -- --model openai/gpt-5.5
npm run start-bot -- --model google/gemini-3.5-flash
```

You can use **any model ID** from the [OpenRouter models page](https://openrouter.ai/models).

### In-Game Command

While playing, type in Minecraft chat:

```
!model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
```

Type `!model` with no arguments to see the current model.

## 🎮 In-Game Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!tools` | List all available tools |
| `!help` | Show help overview |

### AIGuy Tool Surface

| `runCommandSequence` | Runs commands with configurable delays |
| `runSkill` | Runs prebuilt combo skills: `partyMode`, `spleefArena`, `mobBattle`, `parkourCourse`, `rainbowBridge`, `nycCity`, `enchantGear`, `lightShow`, `protectBase` |
